PLP Software Engineering Module - WK07: Advanced Git & GitHub 

Hands-On Assignment: Git, GitHub, And Open Source Exploration 
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with cloning, forking, managing branches, handling conflicts, GitHub Pages, and exploring open-source contributions.

Task 1: Cloning and Forking
1. Cloning a Repository:
  - Choose a public GitHub repository of interest (e.g., a project related to your field of study).
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Explore the repository's structure, files, and history.

2. Forking a Repository:
  - Fork the same repository you cloned in Task 1 to your GitHub account.
  - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

Task 2: Managing Branches
3. Creating and Switching Branches:
  - In your local repository, create a new branch (e.g., `feature-update`).
  - Switch to the newly created branch.

4. Making Changes and Committing:
  - Make changes to a file or add a new file.
  - Commit the changes to the branch.

5. Merging Changes:
  - Switch back to the main branch.
  - Merge the changes from the `feature-update` branch into the main branch.

Task 3: Handling Conflicts
6. Creating Conflicts:
  - In your forked repository, make changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4.
  - Commit the changes.

7. Resolving Conflicts:
  - Create a new branch to resolve the conflict.
  - Resolve the conflict manually in the file.
  - Commit the changes and merge the branch back into `main`.

Task 4: GitHub Pages
8. Enabling GitHub Pages:
  - In your forked repository, create a simple HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
  - Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to `main`.

9. Accessing the Published Page:
  - Visit the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verify that the HTML file is accessible online.

Task 5: Open Source Exploration
10. Exploring Open Source Projects:
  - Search for an open-source project on GitHub related to your interests.
  - Explore the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.

11. Opening an Issue:
  - Open a new issue in the chosen open-source project, suggesting an improvement, reporting a bug, or asking for clarification.

Submission:
- Push all changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Share the link to your forked repository and mention the open-source project you explored with the instructor or submit it as per the class instructions.

Additional Tips:
- Document your process, commands used, and any challenges faced in a text file or in the README of your repository.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the GitHub documentation or seek assistance from peers or the instructor.
